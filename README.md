png editor for banners

To change the images in the editor, just add your png files to the assets/pngs/ folder, and then modify the layerImagesArray.js file. In this file, there is an array for each layer, containing for each line : the name of the png file, and then the name you want to give to the layer. You can add as many lines ( images ) as you want.
